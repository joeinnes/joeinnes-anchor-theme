# Joe Innes's Anchor Theme

I based this theme on Anchor Skeleton Theme, the Skeleton CSS framework, with influence from David Gardner's Manifesto theme (here: https://anchorthemes.com/theme/manifesto)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into ``themes`` in your Anchor installation.
2. Set up your custom fields. At the moment, there are three custom fields to create:
  * ``featured_image`` as a file on Posts. This sets the article's header image.
  * ``featured_image`` as a file on Pages. This allows you to set custom headers for pages.
  * ``page_desc`` as text on Pages. This allows you to add a description for pages to be displayed in the header.
3. Set up your social links. You will need to provide HTML for these links, however, simple A tags and BR tags should allow you to format the list nicely.
4. Set your categories to display in the nav menu
5. Choose an alternative image in ``images/default.jpg``
6. Switch to this theme by picking it in the Site Metadata menu.
